# Pong-Clone
A basic clone of the popular pong game that I made to involve all the knowledge I've gained through programming these programs. I managed to finish this in a day, which may not be too surprising as this is just a pong clone, but considering how this was kida made from scratch, was made by me(a nonprofessional), and my procrastination, I'd say spending just a day is pretty impressive.
